# Astromechanics Aperture Control

This plug allows for the control of the aperture of a Canon lens that is attached to an [Astromechanics ASCOM Canon Lens Controller](https://astromechanics.org/ascom.html). Use of this plugin **requires** a specialized ASCOM driver instead of the official driver from the Astromechanics website. 

**NOTE:** This plugin is useless without the **Enhanced ASCOM Lens Driver**. Please refer to [this plugin's website](https://daleghent.com/astromechanics-aperture-control) for full details on installation and use.
